### Remote control for a high definition Wifi music player
The Bluesound Android app is a remote control for a suite of Bluesound music players. The Bluesound brand is developed by The Lenbrook Group who have also created the NAD Electronics brand. A leading brand in high performance home theatre and hi-fi systems.

### Local library, music services and internet radio
The Bluesound devices play local music from a hard drive, USB-stick or network folder, but also a multiple of music services like WiMP and Rdio and internet radio stations like TuneIn and Aupeo. More services are added frequently.

### Multi-room devices
All your favourite music in one place, with one remote controller, that was the vision of the Bluesound team. In one place? If you have multiple players in your setup the players can connect with each other and play music in sync, across all the connected players.

### Rewritten from scratch
The Bluesound vision and project started years ago. I was contacted to pick-up the project, where another team could not deliver. I've rewritten the app from scratch and introduced the Android Design patterns as much as I could, and as much as that would fit Lenbrook's vision with the Bluesound client apps.
