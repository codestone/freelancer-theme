### Architecture, development and training in 6 weeks
The TU Trace Android app was initiated by the Young TU group within the Technische Unie. It basically is a Track&Trace app for customers of the Technische Unie. I was responsible for setting up the app architecture, development and Android training of Technische Unie personell in a period of 6 weeks.
