###Anno 2011
Since August 2011 I've been giving Android Workshop for beginners. I've since then given this workshop about 10 ten times and still host them yearly at [Appril](http://apprilfestival.com/events/android-beginners-workshop/).

###Workshop on-line and free!
The workshop content is freely available [here](https://github.com/dutchaug/beginners-workshop/blob/master/README.md) if you want to see what the workshop is all about.
