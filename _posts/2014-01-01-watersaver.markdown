### Native client wrapper
The Watersaver Android app is a native client wrapper, which serves HTML5 content via the WebView component. It mixes native controls with WebViews wherever this makes sense in terms of usability.

### Custom keyboard
One of the fun bits of this project was that I had to create a custom keyboard in Android to make a super fast water meter level editing experience for the users.
